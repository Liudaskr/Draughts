# Draughts
This is my recreation of the international draughts board game.
Currently we have a game that is played by two computers (computer vs computer), with a few changes in the code it's possible to play against the computer and to play against yourself.
The AI is non-existant, the computer just makes random moves, but in the future, the AI will be able to make smarter moves based on position evaluations.
To my knowledge, the game is played according to all of the rules of international draughts. The only rules missing are endgame rules where after a certain number of moves, positions are decided as drawn.
